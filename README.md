# gfc


(Partial) implementation of a generalized-feistel cipher [1, alg. 3] for generating random permutations.  
It uses [Speck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speck_%28cipher%29) 64/128 as the random function.  
The Speck implementation is from the [madmo/speck](https://github.com/madmo/speck) ISC-licensed implementation.

```c
GFC* gfc_init(uint64_t range, uint64_t rounds, uint64_t seed);
void gfc_destroy(GFC* gfc);
uint64_t gfc_encrypt(GFC* gfc, uint64_t m);
```
