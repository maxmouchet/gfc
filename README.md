(Partial) implementation of a Generalized-Feistel Cipher [1, alg. 3] for generating random permutations.  
It uses [Speck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speck_%28cipher%29) 64/128 as the random function.  
The Speck implementation is from [madmo/speck](https://github.com/madmo/speck) and is licensed under the ISC license (MIT-compatible).

This implementation is not cryptographically-secure as we use only 16 rounds of Speck instead of 27 ([`#define SPECK_ROUNDS 16`](https://github.com/maxmouchet/gfc/blob/main/src/gfc.c)).

### C API

```c
GFC* gfc_init(uint64_t range, uint64_t rounds, uint64_t seed);
void gfc_destroy(GFC* gfc);
uint64_t gfc_encrypt(GFC* gfc, uint64_t m);
```

### Python API

```python
from pygfc import Permutation
# Permutation(range, rounds, seed)
perm = Permutation(2 ** 16, 8, 42)
assert set(perm) == set(range(2 ** 16))
```
